    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Opening a restaurant is a very challenging task. As a start, it is very important to decide the location wisely. The current situation is that an entrepreneur usually carelessly relies on common sense and domain knowledge to choose a restaurant type and a good spot. Needless to say that too often an inconsiderate decision leads to a poor income and inevitable bankruptcy.\n",
    "Where to open it?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I do not know the business rules in Toronto. In the Netherlands, it is not allowed that you open a restaurant where there are no restaurants nearby. In other words, the government tries to group all restaurants together in a city center or a shopping area. You can not buy a house near a school and start a fast food restaurant there.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As a starter, an easy way is to open a restaurant where it is surrounded by other restaurants. Because you do not need to worry about customers. You can simply share them with other business. Then the restaurant can build up its reputation and grow in to a mature business. Once it is getting famous, we may move it because customers will follow.  \n",

    "To sum up as a starter, opening a new restaurant should be where most of restaurants are.  \n",
